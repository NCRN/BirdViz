<h3>Project Information</h3>

<p>This website presents the long-term monitoring results of the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/im/midn/index.htm">Mid-Atlantic Inventory and
Monitoring Network&#8217;s</a> (MIDN) <a href="https://www.nps.gov/im/midn/breeding-birds.htm">Breeding Bird Monitoring
Program</a>. Established in 2009, this program is administered by Mid-Atlantic Network staff in cooperation with the
Natural Resource Management (NRM) staff of each participating park and utilizes
citizen scientists to aid in data collection.</p>

<p>The primary objectives of this program are to determine the status and long-term
trends in breeding bird species composition, relative abundance, and occupancy,
and evaluate changes in bird populations relative to park management regimes.</p>

<p>The information on this website is based on repeated visits to permanent monitoring
points located within each participating park. Each point is visited at least twice
per year, between May 20<sup>th</sup> and July 15<sup>th</sup>. At each visit, all birds seen or heard
during a ten minute counting period are recorded. Additionally, observers
indicate the distance to each bird they observe, and place them into two
distance categories, less than 50 meters from the observer, or 50 meters and
beyond. For detailed information on the monitoring methods used, please consult
the data collection protocol listed in the Citations &amp; References, under
&quot;About the Project&quot; above.</p>

<h3>Available Results</h3>

<p><strong>Individual Species</strong></p>

<p>You can use this site to explore data on the individual species that have been detected
during monitoring. The results from each of the two visits are presented
separately, and on the map you can display the maximum of the two visits. As
many of the birds are territorial, in many cases the same individual birds will
be present during both visits in a year. For this reason adding the number of
birds seen in visit1 and the number seen in visit 2 is not meaningful. You can
display only the birds closest to the observer, or those at longer distances.
Including longer distances increases the data available. However, birds at
further distances are harder to detect, so the most complete data will be from
the closest distance band. </p>

<p><strong>Number of Species</strong></p>

<p>You can
also explore how many species were detected by the monitoring crew at a single
point or across entire parks. This data only includes species detected during
monitoring. Many species will be present in parks, but not detected, so this is
an underestimate of the total number of species. You can get a complete list of
all detected bird species for each park from the &quot;Species List&quot; menu.</p>

<p><strong>Bird Community Index</strong></p>

<p>The Bird Community Index (BCI- O'connell et al 1998, 2000) is
an index designed to indicate he conservation status of the bird community in
forested areas such as those in NETN parks. To calculate this, the list of
birds from each point is considered separately. If a point has many bird
species that are typically restricted to intact forest areas (&quot;forest
obligates&quot;) the point gets a high score, whereas birds that live in a
variety of areas (&quot;generalists&quot;) give a point a low score.</p>

<p>Many factors are used to assess the
degree to which a bird species is a generalist or a forest obligate. These
include: </p>
<p>
<ul>
 <li>What habitat does the species prefer?</li>
 <li>Is the species restricted to the interior of forests?</li>
 <li>Where does the species nest (trees, shrubs, ground, etc)?</li>
 <li>What does the species eat (insects in bark, insect on the ground, omnivore,etc) </li>
 <li>Does the species a predator or parasite of other bird's nests?</li>
 <li>Is it an exotic species?</li>
 <li>Is the species resident year round or does it migrate?</li>
 <li>How many broods does the species raise per year?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Based on these assessments each point is assigned a score. The scores are then averaged for the entire park.
This average score is used to categorize the bird community of the park as either Low, Medium, High or Highest Integrity. </p>

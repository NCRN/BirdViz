<h4>Birds Found During Monitoring</h4>
This list displays all of the bird species found during the ongoing bird monitoring program. By default, the list includes all species from all points (sampling locations) in a park. If you want a list for specific points, delete "All Points" and select one or more points from the dropdown. The name of a point can be found by hovering over it on the 'Map' panel.

<h4>All Birds Known from the Park</h4>
This list displays all of the bird species in a park with an occurrence status of “present” or “probably present” based on existing evidence within <a href=https://irma.nps.gov/NPSpecies/> NPSpecies</a>, the master biodiversity database for the National Park Service. For more information, including species lists and occurrence status of other groups, visit the  <a href=https://irma.nps.gov/NPSpecies/> NPSpecies</a> page.

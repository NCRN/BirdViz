    <li><strong>Only birds found during monitoring</strong>
    This list displays all of the bird species observed during the ongoing monitoring program. By default, this is shown for all of the monitoring points in a park. If you want to see a list for only certain points, you can delete "All Points" from the "Points (optional)" control and choose one or more points. The name of a point can found by hovering over it on the 'Map' panel.
    </li>

    <li><strong>All birds known from the park</strong>
     This is a list of all bird species believed to be present in the parks. This list is a subset of the data managed in NPSpecies, which is the master biodiversity database for the National Park Service. For more information, including species lists of other groups, such as birds and mammals, visit the National Park Service's  <a href="https://irma.nps.gov/NPSpecies/">  NPSpecies</a> page.

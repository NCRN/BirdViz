<h3> Project Information</h3>

<p>This website presents the results of long-term monitoring of forest breeding birds in eleven national parks in and around Washington DC.The study is part of the monitoring efforts of the <a href="http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/units/ncrn/">National Capital Region Network (NCRN) Inventory and Monitoring Program</a>. The National Capital Region Network's Forest Bird monitoring protocol has been implemented since 2007 in partnership with the University of Delaware, <a href="http://canr.udel.edu/enwc/"> Department of Entomology and Wildlife Ecology </a>.   The princiapl invsetigator, <a href="http://canr.udel.edu/faculty/shriver-greg/">Greg Shriver</a>, has mentored three graduate students as part of this program and provided avian field sampling experiences to over 20 young ecologists.</p>

<p>The monitoring program began in 2007 with the goal of determining the status of and trends in birds that breed in the forests in the parks. The information on this website is based on repeated visits to permanent monitoring points which are randomly located in the forested areas of the parks. Each point is visited twice a year, once during the late spring to early summer and a second time during early to mid-summer. At each visit all birds heard or seen during a ten minute period are recorded. Additionally, the observers indicate if each bird was closer that 50 meters, between 50 and 100m meters away, or further than 100 meters. For detailed information on the methods, please consult the data collection protocol listed in the Citations & References, under "About the Project" above.</p>

<h3> Available Results</h3>

<p><strong>Individual Species</strong></p>

<p>You can use this site to explore data on the individual species that have been detected during monitoring. Th results from each of the two visits are presented separately, and on the map you can display the maximum of the two visits. As many of the birds are territorial, in many cases the same individual birds will be present during both visits in  a year. For this reason adding the number of birds seen in visit1 and the number seen in visit 2 is not meaningful. You can display only the birds closest to the observer, or those at longer distances. Including longer distances increases the data avialable. However, birds at further disatnces are harder to detect, so the the most complete data will be from the closest distance band. </p>


<p><strong>Number of Species</strong></p>

<p>You can also explore how many species were detected by the monitoirng crew at a single point or across entire parks. This data only includes species detected during monitoring. Many species will be presnet in parks, but not detected, so this is an underestimate of the total number of species. You can get a complete bird species list for the park from the "Species List" menu.</p>


<p><strong>Bird Community Index</strong></p>

<p>The Bird Community Index (BCI- O'connell et al 1998, 2000) is an index designed to indicate he conservation status of the bird community in forested areas such as those in National Captial Region Network parks. To calculate this, the list of birds from each point is considered separately. If a point has many bird species that are typically restricted to intact forest areas ("forest obligates") the point gets a high score, whereas  birds that live in a vareity of areas ("generalists") give a point a low score.</p>

Many factors are used to assess the degree to which a bird species is a generalist or a forest obligate. These include:
<ul>
  <li>What habitat does the species prefer?</li>
  <li>Is the species restricted to the interior of forests?</li>
  <li>Where does the species nest (trees, shrubs, ground, etc)?</li>
  <li>What does the species eat (insects in bark, insect on the ground, ominvore, etc)?</li>
  <li>Does the species a predator or parasite of other bird's nests?</li>
  <li>Is it an exotic species?</li>
  <li>Is the species resident year round or does it migrate?</li>
  <li>How many broods does the species raise per year?</li>
</ul>
Based on these asssements each point is assinged a score. The scores are then avearged for the entire park. This average score is used to catagorize the bird community of the park as eihter Low, Medium, High or Highest Inegrity.

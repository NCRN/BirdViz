<h3>Project Information</h3>

<p>This website presents the results of long-term monitoring of forest breeding birds
in eleven national parks in the northeastern USA. The study is part of the
monitoring efforts of the <a href="https://science.nature.nps.gov/im/units/netn/">Northeast Temperate (NETN)
Inventory and Monitoring Program</a>. NETN&#8217;s <a
href="https://science.nature.nps.gov/im/units/netn/monitor/programs/breedingLandbird/breedingLandbird.cfm">LandBird monitoring protocol</a> has been implemented since
2007 in partnership with the <a href="https://vtecostudies.org/">Vermont Center
of Ecostudies</a>. The principal investigator, <a
href="https://vtecostudies.org/about-us/staff/steve-faccio/">Steve Faccio</a>,
also the co-founder of the Vermont Center for Ecostudies,
is a Conservation Biologist with over 25 years&#8217; experience in working in
forest ecology, including long-term population monitoring of forest songbirds,
ecology of pool-breeding amphibians, and vernal pool mapping and conservation.
Steve coordinates all aspects of the monitoring by finding and training
volunteer birders to collect the data.</p>

<p>This
monitoring program began in 2007 with the goal of determining the status of and
trends in birds that breed in the forests and open grasslands of our parks. The
specific monitoring objectives are to determine long-term trends in species
composition of native and non-native landbirds and to determine
changes in relative abundance of the 10 most commonly detected species at each
park the combined suite of Partners in Flight Priority Species at each park, as
determined by Bird Conservation Regions.</p>

<p>The
information on this website is based on repeated visits to permanent monitoring
points which are located across our parks. Each point is visited once or twice
a year, during the late spring to mid-summer. At each visit all birds heard or
seen during a ten minute period are recorded. Additionally, the observers
indicate if each bird was closer than 50 meters, between 50 and 100m meters
away, or further than 100 meters. For detailed information on the methods,
please consult the data collection protocol listed in the Citations &amp;
References, under &quot;About the Project&quot; above.</p>

<h3>Available Results</h3>

<p><strong>Individual
Species</strong></p>

<p>You can use this site to explore data on the individual species that have been detected
during monitoring. The results from each of the two visits are presented
separately, and on the map you can display the maximum of the two visits. As
many of the birds are territorial, in many cases the same individual birds will
be present during both visits in a year. For this reason adding the number of
birds seen in visit1 and the number seen in visit 2 is not meaningful. You can
display only the birds closest to the observer, or those at longer distances.
Including longer distances increases the data available. However, birds at
further distances are harder to detect, so the most complete data will be from
the closest distance band. </p>

<p><strong>Number
of Species</strong></p>

<p>You can also explore how many species were detected by the monitoring crew at a single
point or across entire parks. This data only includes species detected during
monitoring. Many species will be present in parks, but not detected, so this is
an underestimate of the total number of species. You can get a complete bird
species list for the park from the &quot;Species List&quot; menu.</p>

<p><strong>Bird
Community Index</strong></p>

<p>The Bird Community Index (BCI- O'connell et al 1998, 2000) is
an index designed to indicate he conservation status of the bird community in
forested areas such as those in NETN parks. To calculate this, the list of
birds from each point is considered separately. If a point has many bird
species that are typically restricted to intact forest areas (&quot;forest
obligates&quot;) the point gets a high score, whereas birds that live in a
variety of areas (&quot;generalists&quot;) give a point a low score.</p>

<p>Many factors are used to assess the
degree to which a bird species is a generalist or a forest obligate. These
include: </p>
<p>
<ul>
 <li>What habitat does the species prefer?</li>
 <li>Is the species restricted to the interior of forests?</li>
 <li>Where does the species nest (trees, shrubs, ground, etc)?</li>
 <li>What does the species eat (insects in bark, insect on the ground, omnivore,etc) </li>
 <li>Does the species a predator or parasite of other bird's nests?</li>
 <li>Is it an exotic species?</li>
 <li>Is the species resident year round or does it migrate?</li>
 <li>How many broods does the species raise per year?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Based on these assessments each point is assigned a score. The scores are then averaged for the entire park.
This average score is used to categorize the bird community of the park as either Low, Medium, High or Highest Integrity. </p>

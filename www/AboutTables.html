    <p>These tables display a variety of summary information about forest birds. The upper table provides summaries for each park while the bottom table provide data from each monitoring point. If you wish to locate a particular monitoring point on the map, click the corresponding row in the lower table and the map will zoom to that point. </p>
  
    <h4>Select Data</h4>
    This allows you to toggle between different types of data to summarize. The options are:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Individual Species: </strong>The lower table indicates the number of birds of the selected species that were detected at each visit to each monitoring point during the selected year(s). The upper table is the the average (mean) number of individuals detected at the points in the park for the same time period. This is calculated by dividing the total number of birds detected at each visit by the total number of points monitored. Data from the first and second visits to each point is listed separately. </li>
  <!--
      <li><strong>Individual Species- All detections: </strong>The lower table lists every instance where the selected species has been detected during monitoring.  The upper table indicates how often the species was detected at the monitoring points. "Points where Found" it the number of points where the species was detected during one of the two visits for each year. This is summed across all years - so if a species has been detected on the same plot five different years, it will be counted all five times. "Total Points Monitored" is the number of points monitored per year summed across all years. "Percent" is the percent of points with the bird species. </li>
      -->
      <li><strong>Number of Species: </strong> The lower table is the number of species observed at each monitoring point during the selected year. The upper table is the number of species observed in each park during that year.  </li>
      <li><strong>Bird Community Index (BCI): </strong> This is an index that indicates if the bird community has birds typical of forest habitats ("High Integrity") or has more generalist birds ("Low Integrity"). See "Project Information" on the "About"" tab for more information on this index. The lower table displays the BCI for each point and the upper table is the BCI for each park. </li>  
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Park</strong>You can choose to view data from a single park or all parks that are monitored. This choice only changes the data displayed in the lower table, the upper summary table always displays data from all parks. </p>
    <h4>Options</h4>
    <p><strong>Species: </strong> This option is only available the "Individual Species" option is chosen under "Select Data". This allows you to select which species to display.</p>

    <p><strong>Year: </strong>Monitoring points are visited twice each year. You can choose which year(s) to display using the slider.</p>

    <p><strong>Distance from Observer: </strong>When birds are observed, the monitoring crew notes if the bird was 0-50 meters away, 50-100 meters away or further than 100 meters. Birds that are closer are easier to detect and identify, so the closer data may be more accurate. However, using all the data may gives a better indication of the species present in an area.</p>

<p><strong>Hide points with no detections: </strong> This check box is only visible when viewing the "Individual Species" table. It allows you to hide points where the species was not detected.</p>

<p><strong>Names: </strong>
Use this to indicate if you want to use common names, Latin names, or American Ornithological Union (AOU) codes.</p>

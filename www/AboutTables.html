    <p>These tables display a variety of summary information about birds in our parks. The upper table provides summaries for each park while
       the bottom table provide data from each monitoring point. If you wish to locate a particular monitoring point on the map, click the
        corresponding row in the lower table and the map will zoom to that point. </p>

    <h4>Select Data</h4>
    This allows you to toggle between different types of data to summarize. The options are:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Individual Species: </strong>The upper table is the the average (mean) number of individuals
       detected at the points in the park for the same time period. This is calculated by dividing the total number of birds detected at each
        visit by the total number of points monitored. Data from the first and second visits to each point is listed separately. The lower table
        indicates the number of birds of the selected species that were detected at each visit to each monitoring point during the selected
        year(s).  </li>
      <li><strong>Number of Species: </strong> The lower table is the number of species observed at each monitoring point during the selected
         year. The upper table is the number of species observed in each park during that year.  </li>
      <li><strong>Bird Community Index (BCI): </strong> This is an index that indicates if the bird community has birds typical of forest
         habitats ("High Integrity") or has more generalist birds ("Low Integrity"). See "Project Information" on the "About the Project" tab for more information on this index. The lower table displays the BCI for each point and the upper table is the BCI for each park. </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Park: </strong>You can choose to view data from a single park or all parks that are monitored. This choice only changes the data
       displayed in the lower table, the upper summary table always displays data from all parks. </p>
    <h4>Options</h4>
    <p><strong>Species: </strong> This option is only available the "Individual Species" option is chosen under "Select Data". This allows you to select which species to display.</p>

    <p><strong>Year: </strong>Monitoring points are visited twice each year. You can choose which year(s) to display using the year selector.</p>

    <p><strong>Distance from Observer: </strong>When birds are observed, the monitoring crew notes how far the bird is from the observer. Birds that are closer are easier to detect and identify, so the closer data may be more accurate. However, using all the data may gives a better indication of the species present in an area.</p>

<p><strong>Hide points with no detections: </strong> This check box is only visible when viewing the "Individual Species" table. It allows you to hide points where the species was not detected.</p>

<p><strong>Names: </strong>
Use this to indicate if you want to use common names, Latin names, or American Ornithological Union (AOU) codes.</p>

    <p>These tables display a variety of summary information about birds in our parks observed during monitoring. The upper table provides summaries for each park while the bottom table provide data from each monitoring point. If you wish to locate a particular monitoring point on the map, click the corresponding row in the lower table and the map will zoom to that point. </p>

    <h4>Select Data</h4>
    This allows you to toggle between different types of data to summarize. The options are:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Individual Species: </strong> summarizes the number of detections of a selected species filtered by several options (described below). The upper table displays the average (mean) number of individuals detected per monitoring point for each park. This is calculated by dividing the total number of birds detected by the total number of monitoring points sampled. Results are displayed for each visit and the maximum number of detections across all visits. The lower table displays the number of detections for each monitoring point.</li>
      <li><strong>Number of Species: </strong> summarizes species richness or the total number of species observed. The upper table displays the total number of species observed across all visits in each park during the selected year and distance from observer. The lower table displays the total number of species observed at each monitoring point across all visits during the selected year and distance from observer.  </li>
      <li><strong>Bird Community Index (BCI): </strong> displays the BCI score for each monitoring point (lower table) or the mean BCI score for each park (upper table). The BCI is an index of biotic integrity developed by Oâ€™Connell and others (1998, 2000). Higher BCI scores (indicating higher biotic integrity) describe a bird community in which specialists are well-represented relative to generalists. Each BCI score corresponds to one of four categories of ecological integrity (Highest, High, Medium, and Low Integrity). See "Project Information" on the "About the Project" tab for more information on this index. </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Park: </strong>You can choose to view data from a single park or all parks that are monitored. This choice only changes the data displayed in the lower table, the upper summary table always displays data from all parks.  </p>
    <h4>Options</h4>
    <p><strong>Species: </strong> This option is only available when the "Individual Species" option is selected under "Select Data". This allows you to select which species to display.</p>

    <p><strong>Year: </strong>Choose which year(s) to display using the year selector.</p>

    <p><strong>Distance from Observer: </strong> When birds are detected during point counts, the observer estimates how far the bird is from the observer and assigns it to one of several distance bands. You can filter the results displayed by increasingly large distance bands using these options.</p>

<p><strong>Hide points with no detections: </strong> This check box is only visible when viewing the "Individual Species" table. It allows you to hide points where the species was not detected.</p>

<p><strong>Names: </strong> Use this to indicate if you want to use common names, Latin names, or American Ornithological Union (AOU) codes.</p>

      <p>This map displays the results of an ongoing forest bird monitoring program conducted by the National Park Service in eleven parks in the Washington DC area. Each circle indicates the location of a bird monitoring point. Hovering over and/or clicking on a circle will produce a popup with additional infomration. For detail on monitoring methods, select "Project Information" from the "About" tab.</p>
      <h4>Map Controls</h4>
      <strong>Data to map: </strong>
      This allows you to toggle between differentt types of data to display on the map. These include:
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Individual Species: </strong>This is an esimtate of how many individuals of a given species were observed at each monitoring point during a given year.</li>
      <li><strong>Number of Species: </strong> This is the number of species observed at monitoring point during a given year. Clicking on a point will give you the full species list for that point.  </li>
      <li><strong>Bird Community Index (BCI): </strong> This is an index that indicates if the bird community has birds typical of forest habitats ("High Integrity") or has more generalist birds ("Low Integrity"). See "Project Information" on the "About"" tab for more information on this index. </li>  
      </ul>
  <p><strong>Distance from Observer:</strong>
When birds are observed, the monitoring crew notes if the bird was 0-50 meters away, 50-100 meters away or further than 100 meters. Birds that are closer are easier to detect and identify, so the closer data may be more accurate. However, using all the data may gives a better indication of the species present in an area. </p>

<p><strong>Species: </strong>
      This option is only avialable when "Individual Species" is chose under "Data to Map". This allows you to select which species to display.
    </p>
    
<p><strong>Visit: </strong>
      This option is only avialable when "Individual Species" is chose under "Data to Map". This allows you map the birds observed in the first visit (usually late spring to early summer), the second visit (usaully early-mid summer) or the maximum number observed for either visit. As the same individual birds can be observed in both visits, it is recommened that you do not add the number of birds from the two visits.
    </p>
      <p><strong>Year: </strong>
      Monitoring points are visited twice each year. You can choose which year to display using the slider.
    </p>
      <p><strong>Names: </strong>
      Use this to indicate if you want to use common names, Latin names, or American Ornithological Union (AOU) codes.
    </p>
      <p><strong>eBird Data: </strong>
      This allows you to display citizen science data collected via <a href="http://www.ebird.org"> eBird </a>. eBird is not affiliated with the National Park Service. Data from the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia is displayed.
    </p>
      <p><strong>Days of data: </strong>
      When you display eBird data you can chose how many days worth of data you wish to see. By default you will see data from the last two weeks, but you can see as little as the previous day's data and as much as the previous month's data.
    </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Map Layers</h4>
      <p> This control allows you to add an additional data layer onto the map. Currently two options are avaialable:
      </p>
      <p><strong>Ecoregions: </strong> This selection will map the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/ecoregions/na_eco.htm", target="_blank">Level III ecoregions (Omernik 1995)</a> onto the parks. Ecoregions are areas have similar ecosystems. </p>
        <p><strong>Forested Areas: </strong>This selection will highlight which areas of the parks are forested. This map is based on information from the <a href="http://www.mrlc.gov", target="_blank">2011 National Land Cover Database (Jin et al. 2013).</a> </p>
            
            <br>
            <h4> Zoom </h4>
            <p><strong>Zoom to park: </strong>You can select a park from the dropdown menu and click on "Go" to zoom the map to that park.</p>
            <p><strong>Enlarge plots: </strong>By default, the monitoring plots are dispalyed to scale when the map is zoomed in. The enlarge plots control allow you to make then appear 5, 10, or 25 times larger, which is easier to see.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Show</h4>
            The show panel allows you to hide controls and legends to better view the map. Note that the "Layer Legend" panel will only appear if a map layer is selected.

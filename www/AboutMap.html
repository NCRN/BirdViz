      <p>This map displays results of an ongoing breeding landbird monitoring program conducted by the National Park Service's Inventory and Monitoring Program. Each circle indicates the location of a permanent monitoring point where the bird community is sampled using standardized “point counts”. Hovering over and/or clicking on a circle will produce a popup with additional information. For detail on monitoring methods, select "Project Information" from the "About the Project" tab..</p>

  <h4> Base Map </h4>
    <p>You can select different base maps using the controls in the upper right.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Map: </strong>displays the NPS Park Tiles Standard OSM base map and is the default map with parks marked in green.</li>
        <li><strong>Imagery: </strong>displays the NPS Park Tiles satellite imagery with parks outlined in green. </li>
        <li><strong>Slate: </strong>displays the NPS Park Tiles Slate OSM base map which is similar to the default map but specifically tailored for low vision users. </li>
      </ul>


      <h4>Map Controls</h4>
      <strong>Data to Map: </strong>
      This allows you to toggle between different types of data to display on the map. These include:
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Individual Species: </strong> displays how many times a selected species was detected at each monitoring point. The value displayed can be filtered by sampling year, distance from observer, and visit (described below).</li>
      <li><strong>Number of Species: </strong> displays the number of species detected at each monitoring point. The value displayed can be filtered by sampling year, distance from observer, and visit (described below). Hovering over a point provides a popup that identifies the monitoring point and the total number of species detected. Clicking on a point will give you the full species list for that point. </li>
      <li><strong>Bird Community Index (BCI): </strong> displays the BCI score for each monitoring point. The BCI is an index of biotic integrity developed by O’Connell and others (1998, 2000) for central Appalachian bird communities. Higher BCI scores (indicating higher biotic integrity) describe a bird community in which specialists are well-represented relative to generalists. See "Project Information" on the "About the Project" tab for more information on this index. </li>
      </ul>

<p><strong>Year: </strong>
    You can choose which year to display using the year selector.
</p>

  <p><strong>Distance from Observer:</strong>
When birds are detected during point counts, the observer estimates how far the bird is from the observer and assigns it to one of several distance bands. You can filter the results displayed by increasingly large distance bands using these options. </p>


<p><strong>Visit: </strong>
      During each year of sampling, multiple point counts are conducted at each monitoring point (referred to as repeat visits). We do this because some birds are not detected by the observer conducting the point count and the repeat visits allow us to account for and correct for these “misses.” You can use these options to map the birds observed in each visit or the maximum number observed across all visits.
    </p>

<p><strong>Species: </strong>
          This option is only available when "Individual Species" is selected under "Data to Map". This allows you to select which species to display.
    </p>

<p><strong>Names: </strong>
      This option is only available when "Individual Species" is selected under "Data to Map". Use this to indicate if you want to use common names, Latin names, or American Ornithological Union (AOU) codes.
    </p>

            <h4> Zoom </h4>
            <p><strong>Zoom to: </strong>You can select a park from the drop-down menu and click on "Go" to zoom the map to that park.</p>
            <p><strong>Point size: </strong>When a map is zoomed in, monitoring points are displayed with a default radius. The “point size” control allow you to choose among different radii to suit your visualization needs.</p>

      <p>This map displays the results of an ongoing bird monitoring program conducted by the National Park Service's Inventory and Monitoring
         program. Each circle indicates the location of a bird monitoring point. Hovering over and/or clicking on a circle will produce a popup
          with additional information. For detail on monitoring methods, select "Project Information" from the "About" tab.</p>

  <h4> Base Map </h4>
    <p>You can select different base maps using the controls in the upper right.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Map: </strong>The default, a street map with parks marked in green.</li>
        <li><strong>Imagery: </strong>Satellite imagery with parks outlined in green. </li>
        <li><strong>Slate: </strong>Similar to the street map but specifically tailored for low vision users. </li>
      </ul>


      <h4>Map Controls</h4>
      <strong>Data to map: </strong>
      This allows you to toggle between different types of data to display on the map. These include:
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Individual Species: </strong>This indicates how many individuals of a given species were observed at each monitoring point during a given year.</li>
      <li><strong>Number of Species: </strong> This is the number of species observed at monitoring point during a given year. Clicking on a point will give you the full species list for that point.  </li>
      <li><strong>Bird Community Index (BCI): </strong> This is an index that indicates if the bird community has birds typical of forest habitats ("High Integrity") or has more generalist birds ("Low Integrity"). See "Project Information" on the "About"" tab for more information on this index. </li>
      </ul>

<p><strong>Year: </strong>
      Monitoring points are visited twice each year. You can choose which year to display using the year selector.
</p>

  <p><strong>Distance from Observer:</strong>
When birds are observed, the monitoring crew notes how far the bird is from the observer. Birds that are closer are easier to detect and identify, so the closer data may be more accurate. However, using all the data may gives
  a better indication of the species present in an area. </p>


<p><strong>Visit: </strong>
      This allows you map the birds observed in the first visit (usually late spring to early summer), the second visit (usually early-mid
       summer) or the maximum number observed for either visit. As the same individual birds can be observed in both visits, it is recommenced
        that you do not add the number of birds from the two visits.
    </p>

<p><strong>Species: </strong>
          This option is only available when "Individual Species" is chose under "Data to Map". This allows you to select which species to
           display.
    </p>

<p><strong>Names: </strong>
      This option is only available when "Individual Species" is chose under "Data to Map". Use this to indicate if you want to use common
       names, Latin names, or American Ornithological Union (AOU) codes.
    </p>

            <h4> Zoom </h4>
            <p><strong>Zoom to: </strong>You can select a park from the drop-down menu and click on "Go" to zoom the map to that park.</p>
            <p><strong>Point size: </strong>By default, the monitoring points are displayed as 50m radius when the map is zoomed in. The enlarge plots control allow you to enlarge them to 100m which is easier to see.</p>

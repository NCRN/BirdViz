    <p>These graphs display a variety of summary information about birds in our parks observed during monitoring. Select each of the three tabs ("Individual Species", "Number of Species" and "Bird Community Index") to display a different graph.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Individual Species: </strong>This graph displays the number of birds detected divided by the number of points monitored
    for each visit during each year. The controls at the left allow you to chose which species to and which park to graph.
      </li>

    <li><strong>Number of Species: </strong> This graph shows the number of bird species detected during monitoring in the park for
    each year. Note that this is not the total number of species in the park, as species may be present but not detected during monitoring.
      </li>

    <li><strong>Bird Community Index (BCI): </strong> This graph shows the BCI for each year. The BCI is an index that indicates if the bird
     community has birds typical of forest habitats ("High Integrity") or has more generalist birds ("Low Integrity"). See
    "Project Information" on the "About"" tab for more information on this index.
      </li>
</ul>
    <h4>Select Data</h4>
    <p>This allows you to select the data you wish to graph.</p>

    <p><strong>Park: </strong> You can choose to graph data from a single park or all parks that are monitored.</p>

    <p><strong>Species: </strong>This option is only available when viewing the "Individual Species" graph. This allows you to select
       which species to display.</p>

    <p><strong>Names: </strong>This option is only available when viewing the "Individual Species" graph. Use this to indicate if you
       want to use common names, Latin names, or American Ornithological Union (AOU) codes.</p>

    <p><strong>Distance from Observer: </strong> This option is only available when viewing the "Individual Species" graph. When birds are detected during point counts, the observer estimates how far the bird is from the observer and assigns it to one of several distance bands. You can filter the results displayed by increasingly large distance bands using these options.</p>

    <p><strong>Visit: </strong> During each year of sampling, multiple point counts are conducted at each monitoring point (referred to as repeat visits). We do this because some birds are not detected by the observer conducting the point count and the repeat visits allow us to account for and correct for these “misses.” You can use these options to display results for each visit or across all visits.</p>

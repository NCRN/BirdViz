    <p>These graphs show how the forest birds in the parks have changed since monitoring began. Each of the three tabs ("Individual Species","Number of Species" and "Bird Community Index") contains a different graph.</p>
            
    <h4>Select Data</h4>
    This allows you to select the data you wish to graph. 

    <p><strong>Park: </strong> You can choose to graph data from a single park or all parks that are monitored.</p>
            
    <p><strong>Species: </strong>This option is only available when viewing the "Individual Species" graph. This allows you to select which species to display.</p>

    <p><strong>Distance from Observer: </strong>This option is only available when viewing the "Individual Species" graph. When birds are observed, the monitoring crew notes if the bird was 0-50 meters away, 50-100 meters away or further than 100 meters. Birds that are closer are easier to detect and identify, so the closer data may be more accurate. However, using all the data may gives a better indication of the species present in an area. </p>

<p><strong>Names: </strong>This option is only available when viewing the "Individual Species" graph. Use this to indicate if you want to use common names, Latin names, or American Ornithological Union (AOU) codes.</p>

    <h4>Available Graphs</h4>
  
<p><strong>Individual Species: </strong>This graph displays the number of birds detected divided by the number of points monitored for each visit during each year. The controls at the left allow you to chose which species to and which park to graph.</p>

   
      <p><strong>Number of Species: </strong> This graph shows the number of bird species detected during monitoring in the park for each year. Note that this is not the total number of species in the park, as species may be present but not detected during monitoring.  </p>
   
      <p><strong>Bird Community Index (BCI): </strong> This graph shows the BCI for each year. The BCI is an index that indicates if the bird community has birds typical of forest habitats ("High Integrity") or has more generalist birds ("Low Integrity"). See "Project Information" on the "About"" tab for more information on this index.  </p>

<h3>Project Information</h3>

<p>This website presents some of the results of a long-term study of bird communities in six
national parks in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and New Jersey known as the <a
href="https://www.nps.gov/im/ermn/streamside-birds.htm">Streamside Bird
Monitoring Program</a> carried out by the <a
href="https://www.nps.gov/im/ermn/index.htm">Eastern Rivers and Mountains
Network</a> of the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/index.htm">National Park
Service</a>.</p>

<p>The
primary objective of this program is to determine the status and long-term
trends in breeding bird species composition, relative abundance, and site
occupancy.</p>

<p>Our scientists use a standardized sampling method called
a &#8220;point count&#8221; to record all birds seen or heard during a fixed
amount of time at more than 230 count locations throughout the participating
parks. Each point count is 10 minutes in duration. The same locations are
sampled through time so that changes in the bird community over time can be
documented.</p>

<p>Our scientists conduct point counts at each of the 230 count locations every <u>other</u> year during the peak of
the birds&#8217; breeding season (May, June, and early July). During the years
a site is sampled, four separate point counts are conducted at each location (referred
to as repeat visits). We do this because some birds are not detected by the scientist
conducting the point count and the repeat visits allow us to account for and
correct for these &#8220;misses.&#8221;</p>

<p>During each visit and point count all birds seen or heard during the 10 minute counting
period are identified to species and recorded. Additionally, the scientists
estimate the distance to each bird they detect, and place them into one of
three distance categories, less than 50 meters from the observer, between 50
and 75 meters, or greater than 75 meters. Along with additional information.</p>

<p>For detailed information on the monitoring methods used, the sampling design and other
aspects of the program please consult the data collection protocol listed in
the Citations &amp; References, under &quot;About the Project&quot; above.</p>

<h3>Available Results</h3>

<p><strong>Individual
Species</strong></p>

<p>You can use
this site to explore data on the individual species that have been detected
during monitoring. The results from each of the two visits are presented
separately, and on the map you can display the maximum of the two visits. As
many of the birds are territorial, in many cases the same individual birds will
be present during both visits in a year. For this reason adding the number of
birds seen in visit1 and the number seen in visit 2 is not meaningful. You can
display only the birds closest to the observer, or those at longer distances.
Including longer distances increases the data available. However, birds at
further distances are harder to detect, so the most complete data will be from
the closest distance band. </p>

<p><strong>Number of Species</strong></p>

<p>You can also explore how many species were detected by the monitoring crew at a single point
or across entire parks. This data only includes species detected during monitoring.
Many species will be present in parks, but not detected, so this is an
underestimate of the total number of species. You can get a complete list of
all detected bird species for each park from the &quot;Species List&quot; menu.</p>

<p><strong>Bird Community Index</strong></p>

<p>The Bird Community Index (BCI- O'connell et al 1998, 2000) is
an index designed to indicate he conservation status of the bird community in
forested areas such as those in NETN parks. To calculate this, the list of
birds from each point is considered separately. If a point has many bird
species that are typically restricted to intact forest areas (&quot;forest
obligates&quot;) the point gets a high score, whereas birds that live in a
variety of areas (&quot;generalists&quot;) give a point a low score.</p>

<p>Many factors are used to assess the degree to which a bird species is a generalist or a forest obligate. These
include: </p>
<p>
<ul>
 <li>What habitat does the species prefer?</li>
 <li>Is the species restricted to the interior of forests?</li>
 <li>Where does the species nest (trees, shrubs, ground, etc)?</li>
 <li>What does the species eat (insects in bark, insect on the ground, omnivore,etc) </li>
 <li>Does the species a predator or parasite of other bird's nests?</li>
 <li>Is it an exotic species?</li>
 <li>Is the species resident year round or does it migrate?</li>
 <li>How many broods does the species raise per year?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Based on these assessments each point is assigned a score. The scores are then averaged for the entire park.
This average score is used to categorize the bird community of the park as either Low, Medium, High or Highest Integrity. </p>
